title: Blog

<!--

Currently, the title of http://localhost:1313/blog/ is Blogs. This is
intended behavior because Hugo pluralizes the list title according to a set
of common English pluralization rules. We don’t want this, though, so let’s
change it to Blog.

Create file content/blog/_index.md:

```
---
title: Blog
---
```

The leading underscore in `_index.md` is important. If differentiates a
branch bundle vs a page bundle. Read more about this in the page bundle
docs.

Now navigate to http://localhost:1313/blog/ to see the change.
